# RAG System for Income Tax Queries

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide accurate responses to questions about government income tax rules and laws. The system leverages FAISS/AnnoyIndex for efficient document indexing, BERTRetrieval/DPRRetrieval for retrieval and GPT-2 for generating responses.

## Features

- **Efficient Document Retrieval**: Uses FAISS/AnnoyIndex for fast and accurate document indexing.
- **Advanced Language Model**: Utilizes GPT-2 for generating coherent and contextually accurate responses.
- **High Precision and Recall**: Designed to maximize precision and recall for user queries.
- **Comprehensive Data Cleaning**: Implements robust data cleaning processes to ensure high-quality input data. Done via Chuncking and TextCleaning classes

## System Architecture

1. **User Query Input**: User submits a query regarding income tax rules/laws.
2. **Document Indexing and  Retrieval**: The query is mapped against the FAISS index to retrieve the most relevant documents.
3. **Response Generation**: The retrieved documents are passed to GPT-2 to generate a contextually accurate response.
